The stock market can be just as risky as gambling. With uncertain choices and often large amounts of money on the line, people have attempted to 'figure out' the market for years. 

Many people regard success in the stock market as a game of pure luck. However, in life there is no such thing as luck, just adequate and inadequate preparation for a statistical universe.

This app has four features to assist users in answering the crucial "what-if" question when deciding how to invest.

- Allows the user to select certain stocks such as Amazon or Microsoft in order to observe the price trends of the chosen stock.
- Provides a graph of the stock prices with distinct colors so that the user can compare between various stocks.
- Features a "Period" checklist permitting users to view variance in stock prices over different intervals of time.  
- Equipped with a "Benchmark" checklist allowing users to view different stock indexes such as the SP500 or Nasdaq100. 

We hope this app will help you make informed decisions and provide valuable insight into the positions and variance of different stocks on the market.
